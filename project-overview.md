# Project Overview

Project Name: Virtual Time Traveler: Ancient Rome

Description: Step into a curated historical simulation of Ancient Rome. As a "virtual time traveler," users will engage with key figures, make critical decisions, and witness the consequences, all within a visually rich and interactive environment. This project delivers an engaging blend of education and entertainment... though all simulation logic is mocked on the frontend!

Features:

*   Time Travel Portal: A visually stunning landing page that sets the stage for the Roman experience.
*   Interactive Conversations: Mock conversations with historical figures like Julius Caesar, Cicero, and Cleopatra. (AI responses mocked, of course!)
*   Decision-Making Scenarios: Face critical dilemmas that shaped Roman history and see the simulated consequences of your choices.
*   Historical Data Visualization: Explore interactive charts and graphs illustrating key aspects of Roman society, politics, and economy.
*   "Butterfly Effect" Tracker: A fun, visual representation of how your decisions *might* have altered the course of history. (Again, all frontend-mocked!)

Target Audience: History enthusiasts, students, and anyone seeking an engaging and educational experience.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
